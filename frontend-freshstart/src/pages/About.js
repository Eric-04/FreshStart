      <h1>About FreshStart</h1>
      <p>
        FreshStart is dedicated to reducing food waste and ensuring that surplus food
        is distributed to those in need. Our mission is to create a sustainable community
        where no food goes to waste and everyone has access to nutritious meals.
      </p>
      <p>
        We work with local businesses and organizations to recover excess food and
        redistribute it to food banks, shelters, and individuals in need. Every bite
        counts, and together we can make a significant impact on food recovery and hunger
        relief in our community.
